# lakshadweep_float_data_oct_nov_2017
here i am adding lakshadweep float data during oct-nov of 2017 and location plots along with my python program.Time series plots of pressure,temperature,salinity;and csv data.
updated datewise plots of the two floats numbered from 2 to 14 and temp_salin
each file has a set of plots as on the description and are numbered according to datewise(n_profile)
the float 2903125 has 10 set of readings and 2903107 has 4 sets during this aand in that region.Every plot resembles to the one in https://datalab.marine.rutgers.edu/2020/11/introduction-to-python-argo-float-data/?doing_wp_cron=1621610591.7345929145812988281250 and additional time series plots on temperature and salinity of both floats.
